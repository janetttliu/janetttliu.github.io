## NACA0012-PIMPLE-PlasmaMomentumModeling

**Description:**  
This project simulates plasma actuation effects on the NACA0012 airfoil using OpenFOAM. The objective is to develop and validate numerical models to study aerodynamic improvements due to plasma momentum injection.  
The project focuses on implementing the PIMPLE algorithm for transient flow modeling, analyzing flow field changes and aerodynamic coefficients, and comparing simulation results with experimental data. Python scripts are used for automated post-processing of simulation outputs.

**Key Features:**
- PIMPLE algorithm for transient flow modeling
- Analysis of velocity contours, pressure plots, and aerodynamic coefficients
- Validation with experimental data
- Automation of post-processing with Python
